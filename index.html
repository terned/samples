							<span class="callout dark">Novel Songs discusses music mentioned or related to a different novel each show. Novelists use music to place the story in a certain time period, reveal insight into the characters, and sometimes to pay tribute to their favorite songs.</span>

							<p class="column">
							Annie Proulx's <i>Accordion Crimes</i> follows an accordion as it travels across the United States through the hands of different immigrant owners over the course of 100 years.
							</p>
							
							
							<p class="column">
							From the book's acknowledgements:
							</p>
							
							<blockquote>
								The story of the ficitional accordion maker is set into a fictionalized account, based on March 1891 articles in the New Orleans paper the <i>Daily Picayune</i>, of the real 1891 lynchings of eleven Italians in New Orleans. Throughout the book appear real newspaper advertisements, radio spiels, posters, song titles, scraps of verse, labels on common objects and lists of organizations; mixed in with them are fictional and inventend advertisements... song titles... and lists. No characters are based on living, real-life persons. The accordions are what you might expect.
							</blockquote>
							
							<p class="column">
							The accordion stands in for tradition, dreams, aspiration and escape while filling the story with music.
							</p>
							
							<p class="column">
							The reader, encouraged by seemingly supernatural events, can erroniously conclude that the accordion is cursed. The accordion is more likely a symbol of the hope American immigrants had while facing challenges that often lead their lives to end in disappointment or tragedy.

												<span class="callout">It was as if his eye were an ear</span> and a crackle went through it each time he shot a look at the accordion. The instrument rested on the bench, laquer gleaming like wet sap. Rivulets of light washed mother-of-pearl, the nineteen polished bone buttons, winked a pair of small oval mirros rimmed in black paint, <span class="callout"><i>eyes</i> seeking <i>eyes</i></span>, seeking the poisonous stare of anyone who possessed <i>malocchio</i>, eager to reflect the bitter glance at the glancer.
